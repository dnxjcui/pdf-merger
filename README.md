# About
I got lazy and didn't want to pay for Adobe Acrobat. This is a simple, straightforward easy-to-use PDF merger that normalizes page width to A4.

# Instructions
Download and run the .exe in dist/ if you can. My system detects it as a virus (no idea why lol) but if you can get it downloaded it will work.
